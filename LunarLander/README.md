# Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning Project

This section of the repository contains the implementation of a REINFORCE algorithm applied to the Lunar Lander environment from the OpenAI Gym.

## Project Structure

- `REINFORCE_Lunar_Landerv3.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation and explanation of the REINFORCE algorithm applied to the Lunar Lander.
- `weights/`: Directory containing the trained model weights for quick experimentation and testing.

## Implementation Details

The `REINFORCE_Lunar_Landerv3.ipynb` notebook contains the code, along with detailed comments explaining the implementation steps of the REINFORCE algorithm, including the policy network, training loop, and reward signal processing.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook and experiment with the trained model, you need to:

1. Install dependencies (list any required libraries, like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, etc.)
2. Navigate to the notebook and follow the instructions provided within.
3. Use the `weights` directory to load pre-trained models.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook REINFORCE_Lunar_Landerv3.ipynb
