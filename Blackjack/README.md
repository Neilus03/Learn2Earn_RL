# Blackjack Solvers

This folder contains a series of Jupyter notebooks implementing different solvers for the game of Blackjack. These notebooks explore various reinforcement learning techniques ranging from naive approaches to more complex strategies.

## Notebooks

- `blackjack_naive_solver.ipynb`: Introduces a naive agent for playing Blackjack.
- 
- `blackjack_MonteCarlo_Solver.ipynb`: This notebook contains a Statistical Prior Monte Carlo method for solving Blackjack but just focusing on its sum of cards, not the dealer's.

- `blackjack_MonteCarlo_Complex_Solver.ipynb`: This notebook contains a Statistical Prior Monte Carlo method for solving Blackjack focusing both in its sum of cards and dealer's.

- `blackjack_TD_solver.ipynb`: Implements Temporal Difference learning for Blackjack. 

- `montecarlo_firstvisit.ipynb`: Focuses specifically on the first-visit Monte Carlo method for Blackjack.

## Usage

To use these notebooks, you will need an environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks with support for the Python programming language. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
